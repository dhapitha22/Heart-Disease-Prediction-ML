 Predicting Heart Diseases Using the Machine learning algorithm
# Problem Statement
Heart diseases, also known as "Cardiovascular diseases," are conditions that adversely impact the heart. Various types and categories of diseases can occur for numerous reasons and present different symptoms. Examples of heart diseases people may experience include congenital heart disease, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Each disease has unique symptoms and affects individuals differently. Early detection of heart disease allows patients to take necessary measures to mitigate or reduce its effects.

Machine learning has become a popular topic due to its widespread use across diverse fields. It can be considered an application of artificial intelligence, as it enables systems to think and make decisions independently without explicit programming. The healthcare industry can also benefit from machine learning.

This project entails a report or documentation about designing and implementing a pipeline to address this problem as a data scientist. The goal is to determine the likelihood of a person being affected by heart disease based on specific attributes provided.
